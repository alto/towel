=== Plugin Description

ZiYa allows you to easily display graphs in your rails application by leveraging
SWF Charts (http://www.maani.us/xml_charts/index.php). This plugin bundles version 4.5
of the flash library. Incorporating flash graphs in your app relieves the server by
allowing for delegating graph rendering to the client side. Using this plugin, you will
be able to easily create great looking charts for your application. You will also be able
to use the charts has a navigation scheme by embedding various link in the chart components
thus bring to the table an ideal scheme for reporting and dashboard like applications. Your
managers will love you for it !!

    chart and not having to drop to the raw xml. 
- 0.011
  - Added :cache option on ziya_chart helper to attempt to cure the issue with IE displaying the chart in the middle of the canvas. Not sure if this will do it but looks promising from the limited experiments. In order to enable this option just pass in :cache => true in the ziya_chart call. The default is false.
  - Added :timeout option on ziya_chart helper to set a different timeout should the server call takes a long time. 
    ex :timeout => 60 # Sets the chart timeout to 60secs
- 0.012
  - Printing. This is an attempt to correct the printing story in ZiYa. The XML/SWF chart lib files have been updated as well as the ZiYa html helper. 
    <b>You may need to clear your browser cache to force the lib update and also make sure you are running flash > 9</b>.
    We have added a printing sample application to the repository :

      svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/liquidrail/samples/printing

    <b>You must have a valid XML/SWF charts to enable this feature</b>.
    The printing story behind XML/SWF charts is less than ideal. We are pushing on the authors to obtain corrections and patches. If you are a registered user, we encourage you to do the same.
    Here is a matrix of printing scenarios we have compiled. 
    We will need your help validating and completing this data going forward so please pipe in if you see different results.

	  Browser versions : Firefox 2.0.0.4, Safari 3.0

	  Printing was surfaced via a browser page print (P) or print button (PB)

	  Platform      Firefox(PB) Firefox(P) Safari(PB) Safari(P) IE6(BP) IE6(P) IE7(BP) IE7(P)
	  Windows XP    Yes         Yes        X           X        Yes     Yes    Yes     Yes
	  Mac OSX       Yes         No         Yes         Yes      X       X      X       X

    Printing and hidden legends: One more issue on printing. The standard trick for hidden
    legends was to move the legend off the screen by setting the x,y coordinated to negative
    values. Unfortunately this won't work for printing. You will need to set the width, height
    and font-size to zero in order to hide the legend on screen and on print medias.

  - IE6 Timeout
    The infamous timeout issue with IE6 in a deployed environment. 
    Most of you have noticed that ZiYa is working great on IE6 localy, but are getting a 
    timeout once you've deployed to your server. We have added a :cache option to the 
    ziya_html helper which forces the browser to refresh the url. By default this option
    is set to false. The other issue with caching an IE6 is that you will need to setup
    your request header in your controller as follows :

		def load_chart
		   chart = Ziya::Charts::Bar.new
		   ....
		   response.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache"
		   render :xml => chart.to_xml
		end

  - Bug Fixes
  	- Fixed typo in base chart file - Thanks Lori !
    - Fixed issue with series getting the wrong chart_value_text labels
- 0.014
  - Bug Fix
    - Fixed issue with the link component not picking up the correct area component.
- 0.015
  - Bug Fix
    - Fixed ambiguity issue with :series_explode and :series_color not interpreting
      the values correctly. To decipher the short hand notation ie 100, 200, 300 vs
      the array yaml notation ie -100 -200 -300.
- 0.016
  - Bug Fix
    - Fixed issue with background color on flash movie not rendering correctly on IE6.
      Also added logic to default to wmode => 'opaque' if a bgcolor is specified.
- 0.017
  - Bug Fix
    - Fixed issue series_color being set with a single color.
- 0.018
  - Reved up XML/SWF framework to latest version 4.6. 
    NOTE: Make sure you clear out your browser cache !
  - Added flag on ziya_chart helper :use_stage => true/false. The default is false.
    This flag provides for setting up stage_width and height. There has been instances
    where the page layout causes the chart to be offset or not display correctly on both
    IE 6 and 7. We've found that upgrading to the latest version and setting :use_stage => true
    helped prevent the layout flaws on IE.
- 0.019
  - Bug Fix
    - Fixed invalid method empty? problem with label rendering
- 0.020
   - Added Composite chart support. Please take a look at the composite chart sample 
     application for information: svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/liquidrail/samples/charting
   - Added James Hunt patch to correct the object and embed tag generation in the 
     ziya_helper. Thanks James !!
- 0.021
   - Fix issue with series name containing a '%' character. Eliminated the dependency with
     sprintf and the series name.
		
=== Features

1. Allows you to style your charts just like you would an html page using css styles
   philosophy. Each chart can be associated with a YAML file that allows you to specify
   preferences based on SWF Charts properties. Chart style sheet reside under 
   public/charts/themes. By default all styling resides under the 'default' directory.
   Each chart type may have an associated YAML file. You can either inherit the default
   styles or define your own by specifying an id when you create your graph. The styles 
   will cascade thru your graph class hierarchy and override default preferences as you
   would in a style sheet.

   NOTE: XML/SWF charts are free of charge unless you need to use special features such
   as embedded links and printing. 
   The package cost $45 per domain and is well worth the investment.

2. We are leveraging ERB within the YAML file to provide access to the chart state. State
   can be passed in via the options hash when the graph is generated.
   You can also define your own methods in helpers/ZiyaHelpers. You can access these
   helper methods in your style file just like you would in a rails template.

3. Theme support. You can change the appearance and behavior of any charts by introducing
   new themes under the public/charts/themes directory.
      
=== Steps

1. Download and install the plugin. In you rails application issue the following command

   > ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/liquidrail/plugins/ziya/trunk

2. In your controller

   require 'ziya' # <--- Pull in ZiYa

   class BleeController < ApplicationController
     include Ziya # <---- Include ZiYa Charts

	   def refresh_my_graph
	     graph  = Ziya::Charts::Bar.new( license, title, chart_id )
	     graph.add( :axis_category_text, [ "Dog", "Cat", "Rat"] )
	     graph.add( :series, "Series A", [10, -20, 30] )          
	     render :xml => graph.to_xml  
	   end
   end

   The code above will create a bar chart and generate the necessary xml to pass to the client
   for rendering. The chart constructor can take the xml/swf charts license, a chart
   name and a chart id used to lookup the chart YAML style-sheet. If no chart_id is specified
   the YAML file named after the chart class name will be used. So in this case YAML styles 
   will be loaded as follows:

   base_chart.yml
     bar_chart.yml	
	     chart_id.yml

   Preferences will be overridden by the outermost YAML file.

   Sorry no idiot proof validation as of yet, so pay attention to these...

   The add call can have the following options:

   :axis_category_text Specifies an array of value that will be displayed on the 
   x or y axis depending on the type of chart.

   Example: chart.add( :axis_category_text, ['Dog', 'Cat'] )

   :series Specifies an array representing the data points to draw the chart from.
   The next argument is the series name to will be displayed in the chart legends. Next
   is an array of data points. Optionally you can override the default chart labels by 
   specifying an array of label values. You can add multiple :series tags for a given chart.

   Example: chart.add( :series, "Series A", [10, 60, 90], ['Temp lo', 'Temp Avg', 'Temp Hi'] )

   :axis_value_text This option allows you to override the x/y axis ticks depending on the chart
   type. This should be an array of strings that will label one of the chart axis.

   :user_data You can pass user defined params to the chart stylesheet using this argument.
   You will be able to access these values from the chart style sheets via @options hash
   which allows you to provide more dynamic styling based on some given state.

   Example: graph.add( :user_data, :fred, "Fred" )

   Then in you chart style sheet YAML file you can access :fred 

   <%=comp series_color %>
     <% if @options[:fred] == "Fred" %>
        colors: ffffff,000000
     <% else %>
        colors: ff00ff,aabbcc
     <% end %>

   This gives you access to infinite possibilities to change the look and feel of any
   charts based on certain state.

   Additionally you can define methods in a file called helpers/ziya_helper.rb as follows:

   module ZiyaHelpers
     def red
       "ff0000"
     end
   end

   Then in you style file you can access the helper method as follows:

   <%=comp series_color %>
     colors: <%=red%>,000000
   
3. For convenience we have defined a Ziya::Helper that you can use in the view layer
   the define your chart element.

   In your view template you would specify the following:
                           
	 <%= ziya_chart( url_for( :controller => 'blee', :action => 'refresh_my_graph' ), 
	                 :id => 'my_chart', :bgcolor => "transparent", :width => 400, :height => 250 ) %>	

4. The chart styles sheet YAML file follows the various properties that can be
   set on a particular chart. Please refer to the XML/SWF charts documentation.
   
   For example, say you have a bar chart and want to override the default bar colors.
   You will need to perform the following steps:

   a. Specify an chart_id in the chart ctor:
       my_bar_chart = Ziya::Charts::Bar.new( license, nil, "my_bar" )

   b. Create a my_bar.yml in the themes directory as follows:

      <%=chart :bar_chart %> 
         <%=comp :series_color %>
           colors: ff0000,00ff00
   
      Save and refresh your browser and you should now see your new colors...

5. Alternatively you can also specify various themes that will define your charts look and feel.

   You can create a new themes directory under your public/chart/themes directory. Add the various
   YAML chart styles into that directory. To access your new theme you will need to add the following
   line to your controller:

   class BleeController < ApplicationController
     ziya_theme 'my_theme'
     ...
   end

6. That's yet. Happy Charting !!
